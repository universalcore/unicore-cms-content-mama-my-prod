It will mean fewer problems if you get the right care early on.\r\n\r\n You can have tests to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. You can have blood and urine (pee) tests, and tests for HIV. \r\n\r\nIf you know you are living with HIV, you may be able to have free medication from government hospitals to prevent your baby from becoming HIV+. \r\n\r\nEven if you feel well, get regular check-ups so you and your baby can stay healthy.\r\n\r\n",
