The surest sign is a missed period, but you may find it hard to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\r\n - \tYour breasts look and feel different \r\n\r\n - \tYou notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n\r\n - \tYou feel nauseous\r\n\r\n - \tYou need to pee more than usual \r\n\r\n - \tYou miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you see a doctor, nurse or midwife. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new baby. A doctor will also be able to give you advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nA nurse or midwife will weigh you, check your blood pressure and test your urine. \r\n\r\nWorried about seeing a doctor? Ask a friend to go with you.\r\n\r\n",
