  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nFriends and family might offer remedies or tonics or suggest you go to a traditional healer. Maybe you used these in the past but now you are pregnant you need to be very careful about what you take.\r\n\r\nWhen you are pregnant, and when you are breastfeeding, some remedies and tonics might harm your baby. \r\n\r\nA good rule is to check with your doctor or nurse before taking any remedies or medicines. She will be able to tell you which are safe for you and your growing baby.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to remember is not to use traditional medicines or herbs without asking your doctor or midwife first. Some may not be safe to use now you are pregnant. These include food or drinks, tonics, pills, oils and creams you may get from a local healer, bomoh or a traditional medicine shop.\r\n\r\n",
