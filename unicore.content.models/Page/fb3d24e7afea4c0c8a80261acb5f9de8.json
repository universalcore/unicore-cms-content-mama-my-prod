  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nEven if you've never felt breathless before, like lots of women, you may sometimes feel breathless now. This is normal. Your body is adapting, and growing a baby!\r\n\r\nYou can help your breathing by keeping away from dirty air and smoky places. \r\n\r\nDuring long periods of haze, stay indoors as much as possible, and close windows and doors. Wet mop the house to help reduce the pollution in the air. \r\n\r\nDo you smoke? Stop, or cut down now. It is bad for health. Remember, you can save the money you spend on smoking to buy things you will need during pregnancy and for the baby.\r\n\r\nAsk your family to smoke outside.\r\n\r\nIf your house is smoky, open doors and windows. You can reduce smoke when you cook:\r\n\r\n - \tUse gas, electricity, or a kerosene cooker if possible.\r\n\r\n - \tUse a lid. The pot can conserve heat and you can reduce cooking time, and so breathe in less smoke.\r\n\r\n - \tSoak food before cooking to reduce cooking time.\r\n\r\n - \tMopping the floor with water can reduce the amount of dust you breathe in. \r\n\r\nIf you are breathless all the time, you may be anaemic. This means your body lacks iron. Taking iron tablets will help. You can also make sure you eat a variety of foods like leafy vegetables, eggs fruit, poultry and tofu. They will all help your body to get iron. \r\n\r\n",
