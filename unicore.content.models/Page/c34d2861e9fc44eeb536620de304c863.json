Soon you will know what is normal.\r\n\r\nWhile your baby is having only breastmilk, her poo will be soft and easy to pass. It is only when she begins to eat solid food that she may have constipation, when her poo is hard and difficult to pass, and do not pass as often as usual.\r\n\r\nThe signs of constipation are easy to spot. \r\n\r\n - \tIf your baby cries when she passes a stool, this may be a sign. You may also notice her poo is dry and hard. She may also pass fewer poo than normal, sometimes as few as 3 poo a week.\r\n\r\n - \tPoo and wind that smell very bad are also signs. A hard, bloated belly is another.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do? If you think that your baby is constipated, give her plenty of breastfeeds. Breastmilk is ideal. Do not give her water, or any other drink but breastmilk.\r\n\r\nIf your baby has started eating solids, give her lots of fruit and vegetables as well as breastmilk and clean, safe water. This will help to soften her poo.\r\n\r\nSometimes, very liquid poo is a sign of constipation. Liquid poo can move around hard poo that are blocking the digestive system. If you think this is happening to your baby, then see a doctor.\r\n\r\n",
